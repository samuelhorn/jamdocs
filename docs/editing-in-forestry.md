## Start Instant Previews

This starter is pre-configured, but you will need to manually start the preview environement if you want to be able to preview your website.

Go to **Settings / Preview** and click on the **Start** button.

It will clone your site on Forestry preview environment, install the project dependencies, and launch your npm script to launch `gridsome develop`

Once the server is started, you will be able to **click on the preview icon** when you're editing a document (even without saving your changes).

## Adding pages

Go in the docs section and click **Create** to add a new page to your documentation. The default front matter template contains `title`, `date` and `slug`fields. You can add new ones by editing the front matter template.

## Front matter

You can edit the **Documention Page** front matter template by cliking on **Front Matter** in the sidebar. From here you can add new fields to enhance the current template.
